I am a **fourth year** undergraduate at *University of California, San Diego* majoring in **_mathematics_**. My research interests include:
- machine learning
- deep neural networks, and 
- robotics
I am also curious about many different subjects like space exploration, medicine, ecology, energy, and more. As a programmer I hope to make a positive impact on the health and general well-being in whatever field I find myself working in.

### Code snippet
The following is pseudocode for the backpropogation algorithm in a neural network:
```
double learn(double[]& input)
{
    double loss{};
    double threshhold = 1e-7;
    # todo
    while (loss > threshhold)
    {
       # todo
    }
    return;
}
```
