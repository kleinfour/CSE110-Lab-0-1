I am a **fourth year** undergraduate at *University of California, San Diego* majoring in **_mathematics_**. My research interests include machine learning, deep neural networks, and robotics. I also am curious about many different subjects like space exploration, medicine, ecology, energy, and more. As a programmer I hope to make a positive impact on the health and general well-being in whatever field I find myself working in.
